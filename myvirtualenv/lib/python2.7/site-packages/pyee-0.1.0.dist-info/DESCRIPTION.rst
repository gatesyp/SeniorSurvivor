pyee
======

pyee supplies an event_emitter object that acts similar to the `EventEmitter`
that comes with node.js.

Example:
--------

::

    In [1]: from pyee import Event_emitter

    In [2]: ee = Event_emitter()

    In [3]: @ee.on('event')
       ...: def event_handler():
       ...:     print 'BANG BANG'
       ...:     

    In [4]: ee.emit('event')
    BANG BANG

    In [5]: 

Easy-peasy.
